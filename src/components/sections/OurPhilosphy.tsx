                    High callout fees, unreliable availability, cheap products
                    and unprofessional communications channels make it very
                    difficult to maintain your home infrastructure to a high
                    standard. It often feels easier to just ignore the state of
                    affairs while waiting for serious damage in the hope your
                    insurer will foot the bill.

                    than waiting for the larger, painful operation?

                    premiums lower and prevent serious inconvenience.
